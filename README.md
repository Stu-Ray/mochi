# Mochi
This repository holds codes for the artical: Predictive and Semi-deterministic Concurrency Control for High-performance OLTP Databases.

We propose a semi-deterministic concurrency control method, Mochi, to proactively predict, detect and avoid potential conflicts between concurrent transactions during execution.

There are two parts in this repository:

1. Code: the Python codes for analyzing data or training models.
2. TPCC: the workload of our experiments, written in Java.

Experiments are performed on PostgreSQL 13.9.
